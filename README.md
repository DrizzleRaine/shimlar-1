# Shimlar-ish

One of these days we'll stick to an implementation.

### Setup

To run this game type `npm i` to install all the packages, and then `npm start` to deploy the web server. You can access it at the [address that is output](http://localhost:1234).

### Editing Maps

Download [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), you can find the maps in the [maps](https://github.com/project-alfox/shimlar/tree/master/maps) folder. Export it to a CSV, for some reason Phaser can't understand the JSON maps.
