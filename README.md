# Shimlar-ish

One of these days we'll stick to an implementation.

### Setup

To run this game type `npm i` to install all the packages, and then `npm start` to deploy the web server. You can access it at the [address that is output](http://localhost:1234).

### The Docs

Until we get [typescript working](https://github.com/project-alfox/shimlar/issues/1), you'll probably want to keep it open. [\[·¥ò ú·¥Äs·¥á Ä ùüπ.ùü∂ ·¥Ö·¥è·¥Ñs\]](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scene.html)

### Editing Maps

Download [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), you can find the maps in the [maps](https://github.com/project-alfox/shimlar/tree/master/maps) folder. Export it to a CSV, for some reason Phaser can't understand the JSON maps.
